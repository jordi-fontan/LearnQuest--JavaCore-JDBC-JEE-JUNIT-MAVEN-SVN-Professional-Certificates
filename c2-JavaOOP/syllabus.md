Syllabus
Week 1
Classes and Objects
In this module, we discuss why we are using Object-Oriented Programming, and introduce the concepts in Java of Classes, Objects, Attributes, and Methods.

Along with that, we'll discuss some of the conventions of the JavaBeans Specification, and make use of them in our code.

Week 2
Creating Classes
In this module, we'll go into more detail on creating classes in Java, and how to organize classes into packages. We'll cover attributes (instance and class variables), methods, access modifiers, parameters, variable length argument lists, local variables, constants, constructors, overloaded methods, and more.

Week 3
Using Java Objects
In this relatively short module, having discussed, in more detail, creating classes, we'll briefly turn our attention back to objects. How to create them with the "new" keyword, the difference between type and class (something we'll revisit often), and (conceptually) what happens in a JVM when we create a new object.

Week 4
Namespaces and Java Libraries
In this module, we'll look more closely at the use of Java packages. How we declare our package; the implications of being in a package; why packages are important; how we import classes from other packages; what import does for us; how we come up with our own, unique, package name by following the specified rules; how to resolve name collisions. Finally, we will concluding by looking at four specific Java classes: String, StringBuffer, StringBuilder and Math.
